# Gentoo Collection - my collection of Gentoo installations

This repository contains Gentoo configurations for different devices I've done installation on. It will be updated as long as I find something new to document here. Each device contains a few directiories with their own README and files to help setup Gentoo with pre-made configurations.

Current devices:

| Device                 | No-to-full installation | Not working          | Difficulity                                                                                                |

| Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro | ~4 days                 | Everything's working | 2/5 - pretty recent device without exotic features, requires a little configuration to get up and running. |
